##  README: Learning PostgreSQL with Node.js and Express

This repository demonstrates a basic Node.js and Express application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. It's designed to help you get started with learning PostgreSQL development.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A PostgreSQL server running locally or on a remote server.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   (or using yarn)

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

**Configuration:**

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control, as it contains sensitive information like database credentials.

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

   ```
   # Database credentials
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_HOST=your_host
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_PORT=5432  # Assuming the default port is still 5432

   # (Optional) Additional environment variables (if needed)
   # For example, if using SSL:
   # DB_SSL=true
   ```

**Running the application:**

1. Start your PostgreSQL server if it's not already running.
2. Run the Node.js application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   (or using yarn)

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The application will listen on port 3000 by default.

**Explanation:**

The `index.js` file demonstrates the following concepts:

- Connecting to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg` library.
- Setting up an Express application.
- Using environment variables to store database credentials securely.
- Fetching data from a PostgreSQL table (`capitals` in this example).
- Building a simple quiz application that displays a random capital and checks user answers.

**Learning:**

Feel free to modify and explore this codebase to learn more about:

- Creating and managing PostgreSQL databases and tables.
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve data.
- Building Express applications that interact with databases.
- Handling user input and providing feedback.

This is a basic starting point to get you familiar with PostgreSQL development. You can expand on this codebase by adding more features, working with different data types, and implementing more complex queries.
